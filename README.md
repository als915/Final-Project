Final Project Outline: 

My final project is going to utilize photographs I have taken of the various places Iâ€™ve visited. The navigation page will have the three photos up on a bulletin, and when you click on them, they will increase in scale to transition to the drawing page. The individual pages will have outline illustrations that will come together using dash-offset and dash-array to complete the illustration. Once the outline has been completed, the color of the image will start to fill in. Ideally, it would look like watercolors slowly filling in by drips or something similar. The simplified form of this will simply be a slow transition from greyscale to no filter.
As the user drags their mouse around the image, facts and anecdotes will appear. Some of them will be specific to exactly what the person is dragging the mouse over, and some will be more general facts and anecdotes about the country and city. There will be audio clips of either trad music of that area or from videos I have from that location. At least one of the drawings will have motion involved, either in the form of a layered video or the image itself being a video.
